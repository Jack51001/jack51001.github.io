	 Hello there. My name is Jack Viola. I am currently in 10th Grade at New Vista School. I will be creating a website about Pokèmon and everything to do with it in my Computer Coding Class. While we learn a variety of skills in this class, there are a few skills that we will focus on. One of the skills that we will be focusing on is coding. Over the course of the year, we will be using multiple different coding types, such as Python and Java. We will be doing Hour of Code as well to help us improve our skills in a fun and entertaining way.
Web browsers can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

Another skill we will be using is this class is HTML. HTML, also known as  "Hyper Text Markup Language," is used in websites as the markup language to describe web documents. We will be using HTML to create a webpages for our websites. We will be using all of these skills to eventually code ourselves a website. Personally, my website is going to be about one of my favorite games, Pokèmon. The website will include Pokèmon News, Lore, and Game Update. I will also mention the anime as well, but will mostly be focusing on the games. I also am going to add a comment section to as well, so that viewers may post interesting details and their opinions. I hope to have this website done by the end of the year and up on the world wide web. Anyways, thank you for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy!
